Chess Project â€“ a test project aimed at mastering Object-Oriented Programming principles through the implementation of a classic game.
This project follows an MVC architecture and applies software engineering best practices, including encapsulation, modularity, and separation of concerns. The focus is on building clean, maintainable code while simulating real-world development workflows.

Key goals include:
  Deep understanding of OOP concepts (inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation)
  Implementation of game logic using well-structured classes and interfaces
  Practicing MVC architecture in a desktop or console-based environment
  Strengthening problem-solving and algorithmic thinking in a game context

Development is ongoing.
